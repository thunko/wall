Etherum Wallet project ITMO Summer School
name: Jonathan Berrios

Instructions:

1. Clone repository: https://github.com/thunko/wall.git
2. As root, execute make to install services once.
3. Logout out from root and execute the file itmo_ui

Notes:
-For testing the application it was used a new account, therefore there is no fund to be transmitted at this this time. Nevertheless, as the mining is still executing, in the next hours the new account is expected to have more funds to send.

-To test the server feature it is needed to stop the xinetd service. The application will go back to normal after restarting the service.

Thank you.
